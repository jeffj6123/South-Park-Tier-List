A few seconds later, the funnel comes off to reveal a frozen penis. Randy takes a gun out and shoots it to bits. Harris is stunned. Randy walks over to him and smiles. All of a sudden, the penis comes out of Harris' mouth. Randy takes it and puts it into his pants. Harris smiles. Only four cops remain and they clap. The crowd and the other cops have left.]"
