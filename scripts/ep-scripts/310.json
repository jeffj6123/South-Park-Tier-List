I need you.\" I said, \"Can I just come over?\" And the way he held me when I got to his house, it was like, \"Ohhh, this is security.\" And then later on when we were in bed, I'd had my head on his chest, and I was just playing with his chest hairs a little bit, and I said– Excuse me, Butters, are you paying attention?
