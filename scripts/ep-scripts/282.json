        "line": "Shady Acres Retirement Community, day. A different rap song plays - \"They Got Me Locked Up In Here\" by Killer Mike. As it does, the folllowing happens. Toby wheels a man down the hallway, then changes a woman's bed pan. A cook serves up mashed potatoes to a resident and spills some of it outside his tray. A doctor gives a resident some pills, and that resident turns and gives them to Ms. McGullicutty. Other residents line up and do the same. Ms. McGullicutty and her two friends sew the meds into crochet pillows and pass them out to the residents. A resident gives one to her granddaughter, who takes it. An elderly man is working out with small barbells. A resident is in his room looking at his small Hummel collection. The fake plant and mini waterfall are shown. The doctor returns to give another resident five medications. The resident who gave her pillow to her granddaughter says goodbye to her and her parents, then goes back inside with Nurse Lisa. Ms. McGullicutty adds more Hummels to her display case. Stan is at the toy store buying more Hummels. Stan is shown watching the Hummel Shopping Network and purchasing more Hummels over the phone as his friends watch from the sofa. Tony and Toby process Stan again and send him in. Stan gives Marvin a new Hummel. Ms. McGullicutty walks down the hallway with her friends again. Next, Marisol goes over the October activities with the residents. Next the residents go on a tour bus. Next, a kids choir sings for them. Next, canasta is shown. Next, a family says bye to their grandpa and leave. A female resident is wheeled into the hospice section of the retirement community.\nThey got me locked up in here.\nThey got me locked up in here. And I'm sittin' doin' hard time.\nPissin' in a metal bowl, eat shit from a lunch line\n(They got me locked up) And here nobody knows you by your name.\nYou're just a number livin' under bitch-ass rules of a broken game.\nThey put me here to die, left me angry and alone.\nFor the crime of bein' old they threw me in this nursin' home.\nThey got me locked up in here. Rottin' in my cell\nThey got me- Fake plants and waterfalls, it's a livin' hell. \nThey got me locked up in here. So they can throw away their troubles.\nThey got me- All that I have now are my little German\nHummels! Hummels! Hummels! Hummels!\nThey got me- Brand new bitch was just admitted next do'.\nHot piece of ass 'cause she's only eighty fo'.\nNext bingo night I'll pound that pussy black and blue.\nAs long as I can get her before Tommy's grandpa do.\nThey got me- Man I can't handle these old people activities.\nTour group on a bus. Children come to sing to us.\n3 pm canasta, they put me out to pasture.\nDeath row? stop this! I think they call it Hospice\nHospice, hospice, hospice.\n\n\n"
