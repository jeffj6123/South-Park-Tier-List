        "line": "South Park Elementary, morning. As kids pass each other in the hall, Wendy is in the computer lab looking at her picture. She begins to edit it, First she gives her hair a new style, then lifts her beret an inch or two, and shrinks her head. She makes more changes and tears begin to well up in her eyes. She now has hips, breasts, lipstick, blush, eyebrows and eyelashes. She's done, and clicks the Send button, which brings up a confirmation box which asks \"Mass Email File 'My Pic'?\". She moves the cursor to \"Yes\". The mouse doesn't move after that, and she clicks on \"Yes\". She wipes away her tears, pushes herself away from the computer, and leaves the computer lab."
